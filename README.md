# Mars Weather Tracker

This project collects historical Mars weather data observed by NASA's curiosity rover, and displays it alongside 
forecasts from trained models (RNN, LSTM) in a web-application. 

The web-application is updated with the latest weather data on Mars every week. The architecture below is used to 
automate the process of collecting, transforming, storing and retrieving the latest Mars weather data.

Shown below is a demo of the web application displaying daily observations and forecasts of the following quantities which describe the Martian atmosphere:

- Maximum air temperature
- Minimum air temperature
- Maximum ground temperature
- Minimum ground temperature
- Atmospheric Pressure
